# Crop-size-prediction-using-Multi-Label-Linear-Regression-Techniques
The development of multi-target linear regression in the agricultural field is the subject of this research. For crop size prediction, some regression approaches such as polynomials and lasso are applied. The finest model is selected according to the values of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R square, and the MAE metrics.
